# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please understand that *Egress Watcher* may receive heavy modifications with potentially breaking changes on
future versions.

We will try our best to let you know about them either in *PRs*, *issues* or
*discussions* and still support previous features/functionalities for a couple of versions before
deprecating them, but currently the code must not be considered yet in a "stable" state.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** disclose security vulnerabilities publicly, that is neither on discussions nor issues.
Instead, kindly reach out to one of the owners of the project defined at
[OWNERS.md](https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN/egress-watcher/blob/main/OWNERS.md) to discuss the
vulnerability privately via email.

For example, if you find that the project accidentally exposes a password or any sensitive data - e.g.
by printing on console or logs, we kindly ask you to bring this privately.

Typos, unexpected errors, crashes, and in general anything that does not expose sensitive data or does not allow for
unauthorized actions, can be safely brought publicly up in *Issues*.
