# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please understand that *Egress Watcher* may receive heavy modifications as well as breaking changes on
future versions.

We will try our best to let you know about them either in *PRs*, *issues* or
*discussions* and still support previous features/functionalities for a couple of versions before
deprecating them, but currently it must not be considered in a "stable" state and thus you should
expect breaking changes and deprecated functionalities in future versions.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** disclose security vulnerabilites publicly, that is neither on discussions nor issues.
Instead, reach out to one of the owners of the project defined at
[OWNERS.md](https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN/egress-watcher/blob/main/OWNERS.md) and talk about the
issue privately via email.

For example, if you find that the project accidentally exposes a password or any sensitive data - e.g.
by printing on console or logs, you should bring this privately.

Typos, unexpected errors, crashes or anything that does not expose sensitive data or does not allow for
unauthorized actions must be brought up in *Issues*.
